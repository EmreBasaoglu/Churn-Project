Churn Prediction Project
Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn (churn). The project aims to build a model that predicts churn risk from customer data using various data processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Project Content
Dataset: The project uses a large dataset of customer behavior. This dataset includes customer demographics, interaction history, purchasing habits, and other relevant characteristics. The dataset typically contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique ID of the customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is senior (0 or 1).

Partner: Whether the customer has a partner.

Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents.

Tenure: Length of time the customer has been with the company (in months).

PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service.

MultipleLines: Whether the customer has more than one phone line.

InternetService: Type of internet service the customer has (DSL, Fiber Optic, or None).
OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security.

OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup.

DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection.

TechSupport: Whether the customer has technical support.

StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV.

StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies.

Contract: The customer's contract type (Monthly, Annual, Bi-Yearly).

PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing.

PaymentMethod: The customer's payment method.

MonthlyCharges: The customer's monthly charges.

TotalCharges: The customer's total charges.

Churn: Whether the customer has churn (customer churn) (0 or 1).

Data Preprocessing: Data is processed to make it suitable for machine learning models. Steps such as data cleaning, filling in missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical data, and data normalization are applied during this phase.

Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms are used in the model creation phase. Among these algorithms:

Decision Trees: Decision trees are a method that divides data according to various decision rules.
Random Forests: It is a collection of decision trees and generally provides higher accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): It is an algorithm that tries to find the hyperplane that best separates the data.
Logistic Regression: It is a regression model suitable for binary classification problems.
Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated with various metrics. These metrics may include:

Accuracy: The proportion of examples that the model correctly predicts.
Precision: The ratio of the model's true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
Sensitivity (Recall): The ratio of the model's true positive predictions to true positives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity.
Results and Reporting: A report is prepared summarizing the success of the model and the results obtained. This phase evaluates the feasibility of the model and how customer churn predictions can contribute to business decisions.
